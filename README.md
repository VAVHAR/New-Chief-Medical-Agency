# New-Chief-Medical-Agency

We have created a web-based application in Asp.NET C# that will be used by a medical agency.

Since the medical agency currently manages all of its data, including stock updates and order details, on paper or in excel sheets, and it is difficult to manage those data in these ways, we are creating a web-based application so that the medical agency can manage its information about stock and orders in real time at one location. To do this, we are going to have various user roles, such as the role of the medical The stock manager can update the information for already-available medical products as well as upload new medical products with all of their details to the system. When an order is entered into the system, the order clerk enters information about the orders that the company has received from various clients. As the order is entered, the stock is also updated in real time in accordance with the order, and the admin can view all of these details, including stock, orders, supplier information, and client and supplier information. Thus, by employing this, the agency can handle all of its responsibilities in a single location, manage all of its data in a proper format, and save time.

Three initial users—Admin, Stock Manager, and Order Clerk—are part of the New Chief Medical Agency Management System. Without significantly interfering with one another, each of the three users does their assigned tasks.

User 1: ADMIN - The administrator is the owner and is responsible for managing users, assigning input credentials to all employees in accordance with their job roles, and adding new users. To stay informed about the performance of their staff, admin will also be able to examine and generate reports for stocks and orders.

User 2: STOCK MANAGER An employee in charge of inventories would be the stock manager. They would see to it that the supplies were replenished in accordance with needs. Users are able to view stocks and orders, create orders, add and modify products, update stock listings, and create stock reports.

User 3: ORDER CLERK Order clerks are level 3 firm personnel. They are the client's first point of contact with the company. They handle delivery and bring orders for the company. Their application interface will include features like Add Orders, Manage Orders, Generate Order Report, Add and Modify Customers.
